# gmail-clone

In this course, we’re going to build a Gmail clone using Vue 3.

We’ll learn lots of new Vue 3 concepts, including the Composition API, the Reactivity System, and the Suspense Component. We’ll show composables being used side-by-side with the Options API, and talk about the tradeoffs of using each.

By the end of the course, we’ll have built an email inbox where we can check our email, mark it as read or archived, navigate using keyboard shortcuts, and perform bulk actions.
